# LUA ProtoPlug fork

This is a fork of the LUA ProtoPlug project, which you can find here: https://github.com/pac-dev/protoplug

With any luck, some of these changes may end up back in the master branch, but for now doing some modifications here since LUA ProtoPlug doesn't seem to get updated in a long time.

## Modifications

1. AUmfx (aumi) version of the plugin provided for using in LogicPro.

## Under Development

1. Enhnacements to the lua-based midi API which make it easier to script many common midi tasks.
