Scripts placed in folders named "Xin Yout" (where X and Y are numbers of channels) will only be visible to protoplug versions with the corresponding number of channels. 

To make a version of protoplug with any number of channels, simply copy the plugin (`.dll`, `.so`, or `.component`, depending on your platform) and specify the number of channels in the filename. For example, in Windows, copy `Lua Protoplug Fx.dll` and rename the copy to `Lua Protoplug Fx 8in 8out.dll` for a version with 8 input and output channels.
